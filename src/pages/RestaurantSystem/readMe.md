Here is the complete list of feature requirements for each part of your **Restaurant Orders App**, based on your finalized code:

---

## ✅ Part 1: Display Orders

### 🧾 Requirements:

- Render a list of all orders on the page.
- For each order, display:

  - Unique order ID (shortened UUID)
  - Customer name
  - Base dish
  - Protein
  - Spice level
  - Selected dressings (or “None”)
  - Number of servings (quantity)
  - Pickup date
  - Additional notes (or “None”)

- Each order should have:

  - **Edit** button (loads order into the form)
  - **Delete** button (removes the order)

---

## ✅ Part 2: Add New Order (Form with All Common Input Types)

### 🧾 Requirements:

- Form fields include:

  1. **Text Input**: `Customer Name`
  2. **Dropdown (Select)**: `Base Dish`
  3. **Dropdown (Select)**: `Protein`
  4. **Radio Buttons**: `Spice Level` (Mild, Medium, Hot)
  5. **Checkboxes**: `Dressings` (multi-select)
  6. **Number Input**: `Quantity` (min 1)
  7. **Date Input**: `Pickup Date`
  8. **Textarea**: `Additional Notes`

- On submit:

  - Generate a UUID for the order
  - Add it to the orders list
  - Reset the form fields

- Validation:

  - Required fields: customer, spice, base, protein, quantity, pickupDate

---

## ✅ Part 3: Consume Orders from API (Simulated)

### 🧾 Requirements:

- Simulate loading `initialOrders` from an external JSON file.
- Use `useEffect()` to:

  - Load data on first render
  - Add UUIDs to each loaded order
  - Store them in React state

---

## ✅ Part 4: Edit & Delete Orders

### 🧾 Requirements:

- Edit:

  - Click "Edit" fills the form with order data
  - Form changes button text to "Update Order"
  - After submit, update the order in state

- Delete:

  - Click "Delete" removes the order from the list

---

### 💡 (Optional Future Ideas)

- Filter orders by base or spice level
- Persist orders to `localStorage` or backend
- Add toast notifications for actions (added/updated/deleted)
- Disable past dates for pickup date field

Would you like this as a README-style checklist to follow as you build the app from scratch? Or should I prepare a simple version scaffold for you to begin coding right away?
