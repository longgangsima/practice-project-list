# 🔧 Test Setup Guide

## 📦 Install Testing Dependencies

Run these commands in your project root:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
npm install --save-dev @types/jest
```

## 📁 Setup Test Configuration

1. **Create `src/setupTests.ts`:**

```typescript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
```

2. **Update `package.json` (if needed):**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "test:watch": "react-scripts test --watch",
    "test:coverage": "react-scripts test --coverage --watchAll=false"
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Run the Tests

After installing dependencies:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test DisplayOrders.test.tsx

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## 🎯 Expected Test Results

When your implementation is correct, you should see:

```
✅ TEST_1: Should render all orders on the page
✅ TEST_2: Should display shortened order IDs
✅ TEST_3: Should display all customer information correctly
✅ TEST_4: Should display base dish names (not IDs)
✅ TEST_5: Should display protein names (not IDs)
✅ TEST_6: Should display spice levels correctly
✅ TEST_7: Should display dressings correctly
✅ TEST_8: Should display quantity (servings) correctly
✅ TEST_9: Should display pickup dates correctly
✅ TEST_10: Should display additional notes correctly
✅ TEST_11: Should display Edit button for each order
✅ TEST_12: Should display Delete button for each order
✅ TEST_13: Edit button should load order into form
✅ TEST_14: Delete button should remove order from list
✅ TEST_15: Each order should have proper card structure
✅ TEST_16: Should handle empty dressings array correctly
✅ TEST_17: Should display multiple dressings correctly
✅ TEST_18: Should handle empty comments correctly
✅ TEST_19: Should load orders from JSON file on mount
✅ TEST_20: Should generate UUIDs for orders loaded from JSON

## 🐛 Common Test Failures & Fixes

### ❌ "Cannot find element with text..."

**Issue:** Component not rendering expected text
**Fix:** Check data mapping, ensure IDs are converted to readable names

### ❌ "Expected 3 but received 0"

**Issue:** Orders not loading or displaying
**Fix:** Check useEffect, JSON import, state management

### ❌ "Element is not in the document"

**Issue:** Missing buttons or elements
**Fix:** Ensure Edit/Delete buttons are rendered for each order

### ❌ "Cannot read property of undefined"

**Issue:** Data structure mismatch  
**Fix:** Check order object structure matches expected format

## 🎯 Test-Driven Development Tips

1. **Run tests FIRST** (they will fail - that's expected!)
2. **Implement one feature at a time** to make tests pass
3. **Use test descriptions** as your implementation checklist
4. **Check test output** for specific requirements

This approach ensures your code meets all requirements! 🚀
