## ðŸŽ¯ **TESTING SCENARIOS**

### **Scenario A: Initial Page Load**

```
GIVEN: User opens the Restaurant Orders page
WHEN: Component mounts
THEN:
  - 3 orders are displayed
  - All order information is correctly mapped and shown
  - Each order has Edit and Delete buttons
```

### **Scenario B: Data Mapping Verification**

```
GIVEN: Orders are loaded from JSON
WHEN: Displaying order details
THEN:
  - Base dish IDs (d1, d2, d3) are mapped to readable names
  - Protein IDs (p1, p2, p3) are mapped to readable names
  - Raw IDs are NOT visible to user
```

### **Scenario C: Empty Data Handling**

```
GIVEN: An order has empty dressings or comments
WHEN: Displaying that order
THEN:
  - Empty fields show "None" instead of blank
  - No JavaScript errors occur
```

### **Scenario D: Button Functionality**

```
GIVEN: Orders are displayed with Edit/Delete buttons
WHEN: User clicks Edit button
THEN: Form is populated with order data

WHEN: User clicks Delete button
THEN: Order is removed from the list
```

## ðŸ“Š **SCORING (CodeSignal Style)**

**TOTAL: 100 points**

- **Basic Display**: 60 points
- **Functionality**: 30 points
- **Edge Cases**: 10 points

**Grading Scale:**

## âš¡ **IMPLEMENTATION TIPS**

1. **Use `useEffect`** to load orders on mount
2. **UUIDs are already included** in the JSON data - no need to generate them
3. **No ID mapping needed** - dish and protein names are already readable
4. **Handle empty arrays/strings** by showing "None"
5. **Add `data-testid`** attributes for easier testing:
   ```jsx
   <div data-testid={`order-card-${order.id}`}>
   ```
6. **Shorten UUIDs for display** - show only first 8 characters

Use this checklist to verify your implementation before considering it complete! âœ…
