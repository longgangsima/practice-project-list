# 🏛️ Architectural Patterns

## 1. Monorepo Structure Pattern

### Description

Single repository containing multiple related React projects with shared components and backend.

### Implementation

```
react-app/
├── frontend/          # React applications
│   ├── src/pages/     # Individual projects
│   └── src/components/ # Shared components
├── backend/           # Shared API server
└── docs/             # Centralized documentation
```

### Benefits

- **Shared Components**: Reusable UI elements across projects
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified design system
- **Centralized Backend**: Single API serving multiple apps
- **Simplified Development**: One setup for multiple projects

### Used In

- Overall project structure
- Shared layout components
- Common navigation elements

## 2. Feature-Based Organization Pattern

### Description

Each project maintains its own complete folder structure with all related files.

### Implementation

```
pages/ProjectName/
├── index.tsx          # Main component
├── README.md          # Project documentation
├── components/        # Project-specific components
├── styles/           # Project-specific styles
├── types.ts          # Project-specific types
├── utils.ts          # Project-specific utilities
└── api/              # Project-specific API calls
```

### Benefits

- **Encapsulation**: All related code is co-located
- **Independence**: Projects can evolve separately
- **Clear Boundaries**: Easy to understand project scope
- **Team Scalability**: Different teams can own different projects

### Used In

- BookStore project structure
- CardFlips project organization
- RestaurantSystem layout

---

## 3. Lazy Loading Strategy Pattern

### Description

Strategic code splitting where landing page loads immediately while optional pages are lazy-loaded.

### Implementation

```tsx
// Immediate loading for critical path
const HomeContent = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>🧪 Interview Projects</h1>
    <ProjectList projects={projectList} />
  </div>
);

// Lazy loading for optional pages
const BookStore = lazy(() => import('./pages/BookStore'));
const CardFlips = lazy(() => import('./pages/CardFlips'));
```

### Benefits

- **Fast Initial Load**: Landing page appears immediately
- **Code Splitting**: Smaller initial bundle size
- **Progressive Loading**: Load features as needed
- **Better UX**: No loading delay for first impression

### Used In

- App.tsx routing structure
- Project page imports
- Component loading strategy

---

## 4. Layout Component Pattern

### Description

Consistent page structure using reusable layout components with different configurations.

### Implementation

```tsx
// Different layouts for different needs
<ProjectDetailLayout
  currentPath="/card-flips"
  projectRequirements={<Requirements />}
>
  {/* Project content */}
</ProjectDetailLayout>

<ProjectLayout>
  {/* Simpler layout for basic projects */}
</ProjectLayout>
```

### Benefits

- **Consistency**: All pages have similar structure
- **Reusability**: Layout logic is shared
- **Maintainability**: Layout changes affect all pages
- **Flexibility**: Different layouts for different needs

### Used In

- ProjectDetailLayout for complex projects
- ProjectLayout for simpler projects
- Navigation consistency

---

## 5. Progressive Enhancement Pattern

### Description

Start with basic functionality and add advanced features progressively.

### Implementation

```tsx
// Basic implementation first
const CardFlips = () => (
  <div>
    <GameBoard cards={generateCards()} />
  </div>
);

// Enhanced version with advanced features
const RADIOCardFlips = () => (
  <div>
    <GameBoard cards={generateCards()} analytics={analytics} configuration={config} errorBoundary={ErrorBoundary} />
  </div>
);
```

### Benefits

- **Learning Path**: Simple to complex progression
- **Risk Management**: Start with working solution
- **Iterative Improvement**: Add features based on needs
- **Comparison**: Easy to see evolution

### Used In

- CardFlips vs CardFlipsRADIO implementations
- API complexity progression
- Component enhancement over time

---

## 6. Service-Oriented Architecture Pattern

### Description

Separate business logic into service layers, especially in advanced implementations.

### Implementation

```tsx
// CardFlipsRADIO service structure
services/
├── GameEngine.ts      # Core game logic
├── Analytics.ts       # Performance tracking
├── Validation.ts      # State validation
└── Storage.ts         # Persistence layer
```

### Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: UI vs business logic
- **Testability**: Services can be tested independently
- **Reusability**: Services can be shared
- **Maintainability**: Clear responsibility boundaries

### Used In

- CardFlipsRADIO advanced architecture
- API service abstractions
- Utility function organization

## 🎯 Pattern Selection Guidelines

### When to Use Each Pattern

1. **Monorepo**: Multiple related projects with shared components
2. **Feature-Based**: Independent projects with unique requirements
3. **Lazy Loading**: Performance-critical applications with optional features
4. **Layout Components**: Consistent UI structure requirements
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Learning-focused or iterative development
6. **Service-Oriented**: Complex business logic or advanced features

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Choose appropriate folder structure
- [ ] Define clear component boundaries
- [ ] Implement consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Document architectural decisions
- [ ] Plan for scalability and maintenance
