# 🏗️ Design Patterns

Essential React design patterns for interviews and professional development.

## 📋 Interview-Ready Patterns

### **React Component Patterns** ⚛️

- **[React Patterns](./react-patterns.md)** - Container/Presentational, Custom Hooks, Higher-Order Components, Render Props

### **State Management Patterns** 🔄

- **[State Management](./state-management-patterns.md)** - Local vs Global state, Context API, useReducer patterns

---

## 🎯 Key Patterns for Interviews

### **1. Component Composition**

- Container/Presentational pattern
- Compound components
- Render props pattern
- Higher-order components (HOCs)

### **2. State Management**

- When to use local vs global state
- Context API implementation
- useReducer for complex state
- State lifting strategies

### **3. Custom Hooks**

- Extracting reusable logic
- Hook composition patterns
- Testing custom hooks
- Performance considerations

---

These patterns are **frequently asked** in React interviews and essential for scalable applications.

---

## 🚀 Additional Pattern Areas

The following pattern areas are demonstrated throughout the codebase and covered in the React Concepts guides:

### Data Flow & API Patterns

- API integration and error handling (see Restaurant System)
- Loading states and data transformation
- Request/response patterns

### UI Component Patterns

- Responsive design implementation
- Component composition patterns
- Accessibility considerations

### Performance Patterns

- Code splitting with lazy loading
- Memoization strategies (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Efficient re-rendering patterns

---

## 🎯 Pattern Selection Criteria

### When to Apply Patterns

1. **Consistency** - Patterns ensure consistent code structure
2. **Scalability** - Support for growing application complexity
3. **Maintainability** - Easier code understanding and modification
4. **Performance** - Optimized user experience
5. **Reusability** - Reduce code duplication

### Pattern Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start Simple** - Do not over-engineer for current needs
2. **Evolve Gradually** - Refactor to patterns as complexity grows
3. **Document Decisions** - Explain why patterns were chosen
4. **Team Alignment** - Ensure consistent pattern usage
5. **Performance Impact** - Consider the cost/benefit of each pattern

---

**Purpose**: Standardize development approaches and share architectural knowledge across the team.
