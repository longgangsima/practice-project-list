# 🏗️ Design Patterns Guide

This section documents the architectural and design patterns used throughout the React Practice Projects.

## 📚 Available Pattern Documentation

### [Architectural Patterns](./architectural-patterns.md)

System-level design patterns:

- **Monorepo Structure** - Multi-project organization
- **Feature-Based Organization** - Project-specific folder structure
- **Lazy Loading Strategy** - Code splitting and performance optimization
- **Layout Component Pattern** - Consistent page structure

### [React Patterns](./react-patterns.md)

React-specific design patterns:

- **Container/Presentational Components** - Logic separation
- **Compound Components** - Component composition
- **Render Props Pattern** - Flexible component APIs
- **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)** - Component enhancement
- **Custom Hooks Pattern** - Logic reuse and state management

### [State Management Patterns](./state-management-patterns.md)

State handling strategies:

- **Local State vs Global State** - When to use each approach
- **State Lifting** - Moving state up the component tree
- **State Normalization** - Flat state structure patterns
- **Optimistic Updates** - UI responsiveness patterns

## 🚀 Additional Pattern Areas

The following pattern areas are demonstrated throughout the codebase and covered in the React Concepts guides:

### Data Flow & API Patterns

- API integration and error handling (see Restaurant System)
- Loading states and data transformation
- Request/response patterns

### UI Component Patterns

- Responsive design implementation
- Component composition patterns
- Accessibility considerations

### Performance Patterns

- Code splitting with lazy loading
- Memoization strategies (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Efficient re-rendering patterns

## 🎯 Pattern Selection Criteria

### When to Apply Patterns

1. **Consistency** - Patterns ensure consistent code structure
2. **Scalability** - Support for growing application complexity
3. **Maintainability** - Easier code understanding and modification
4. **Performance** - Optimized user experience
5. **Reusability** - Reduce code duplication

### Pattern Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start Simple** - Do not over-engineer for current needs
2. **Evolve Gradually** - Refactor to patterns as complexity grows
3. **Document Decisions** - Explain why patterns were chosen
4. **Team Alignment** - Ensure consistent pattern usage
5. **Performance Impact** - Consider the cost/benefit of each pattern

---

**Purpose**: Standardize development approaches and share architectural knowledge across the team.
